## Apply Type to Function

Sometimes a custom function will resolve an API and then jump to it.  The function prototype of the function that contains this code that both resolves and calls/jumps to the API function matches the corrisponding API function prototype being resolved - simply rename the function and the type is auto applied.

## Settings

All of the features can be controlled (enabled/disabled) via the settings.
